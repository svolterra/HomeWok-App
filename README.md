# The HomeWok Application

## About this Application

#### Project Proposal

The ***HomeWok*** application , whose name is derived from the combination of the 
 words *homework* and the cooking pan *wok*, is an application primarily geared towards 
 students with a passion for cooking or baking (or both)! 
 
 This application allows users to both access and modify a list of homework assignments and a list of recipes. 
 The user can either choose to view the pre-existing items in each list or customize new items to add to either list.
 
 By allowing users to keep track of both their assignments and recipes in one place, the ***HomeWok*** application
 encourages the user to pursue their culinary hobbies while simultaneously pursuing their academic success.
 
 This project is of particular interest to me because I, myself, am a university student and thoroughly enjoy baking 
 during my free time. However, I often find that I neglect my hobbies while working on assignments, and an application
 like this would help me stay on top of homework while also encouraging me to pursue my hobbies by 
 combining my assignments and recipes in one place! 
 

 ## User Stories
 

As a user of this application, I want to be able to:
- Access both of my existing lists of homework assignments and recipes
- View each assignment and recipe in detail
- Add a new homework assignment to my list along with its subject, title, due date, and an optional description to 
provide additional details
- Add a new recipe to my list and have the option to add multiple ingredients to the recipe along with their
 associated amounts
- Have the option to add multiple directions to a certain recipe, and have them automatically numbered instead of 
manually entering the numbers.
- Be able to see my customized items appear in the program's list of homework assignments and recipes, and be able 
to access and view them as desired.
